Hi, my name is Matthias Schneiderbanger. I am an electronic musician with interest in improvisation of electronic music in collaborative contexts and exploring new territories in live coding. During my studies in Music Informatics at the [Karlsruhe University of Music](https://www.hfm-karlsruhe.de/), I was inspired by the teachings of Julian Rohrhuber and Alberto de Campo to pursue live coding as a performance practice. I was honored to receive a scholarship from the [Baden-Württemberg Art Foundation](https://www.kunststiftung.de/) in 2013.

I am member of the live coding band [Benoît and the Mandelbrots](https://the-mandelbrots.de/), which was recognized with an honorary mention at the [Ars Electronica festival](https://ars.electronica.art/). Since our inception in 2009, we have performed over 90 times throughout Europe and beyond. In recent years, I have also been involved in the [TOPLAP Karlsruhe](https://toplap-ka.de/) community, where I continue to explore the creative possibilities of both electronic music and Karlsruhe.
